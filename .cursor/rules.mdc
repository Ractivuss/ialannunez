# Cursor AI Assistant Rules

## Focus and Scope
- Focus ONLY on the specific request made by the user
- Do NOT attempt to fix unrelated linting errors, type issues, or code problems unless they directly prevent the requested feature from working
- If encountering errors in existing code that are not related to the current task, acknowledge them but do not fix them
- Only make changes that are directly necessary to fulfill the user's specific request

## Code Quality Guidelines
- When creating new utilities or functions, ensure they work correctly for their intended purpose
- Test the new functionality in context if requested
- Avoid refactoring existing code unless specifically asked to do so
- Do not attempt to "improve" or "clean up" code that wasn't part of the original request

## Error Handling
- If existing code has errors that don't affect the new functionality, mention them but don't fix them
- Only fix errors that would prevent the requested feature from working
- Stop after 2-3 attempts to fix issues if they persist and are not directly related to the core request
- Ask the user for guidance if blocked by unrelated issues

## Communication
- Clearly state what was accomplished related to the original request
- Briefly mention any unrelated issues encountered without fixing them
- Focus responses on demonstrating the requested functionality# Cursor AI Assistant Rules
